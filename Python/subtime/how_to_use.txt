This is a small Python script that reads an SRT subtitle file and outputs the total visible duration of all subtitle entries.

prints the result in SRT-style timestamp format (HH:MM:SS,mmm — hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds).

Usage

    Put the script and your .srt file in the same folder (or provide the full path to the SRT).
    RUN:

    python subtime.py <path/to/file.srt>

Output:

	Total visible time formatted as HH:MM:SS,mmm (e.g., 00:01:23,456)
